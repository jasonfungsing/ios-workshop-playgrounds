//: ### Basics
/*:
 * callout(variables and constants):
 using `var` and `let`, type annotations and type inference, basic types `Int, Float, Double, Bool, String`, tuples and type aliases
 */


/*:
 * callout(collection types):
 arrays (ordered collections of values), sets (unordered collections of unique values) and dictionaries (unordered collections of key-value associations)
 */


/*:
 * callout(control flow):
 loops (`for-in`, `while` and `repeat-while`), conditional statements (`if`, `if-else` and `switch`) control transfer labels (`continue`, `break`, `fallthrough`, `return` and `throw`), early exit (`guard-else`), checking API availability (`if #available`)
 */


/*:
 * callout(operators):
 assignment operator (`=`), arithemic operators (`+` `-` `*` `/`), remainder operator (`%`), unary and compound assignment operators (`-foo` `+bar` `+=` `-=`), comparison operators (`==` `!=` `>` `<` `>=` `<=`), ternary conditional operator (`a ? b : c`), range operators (`a...b` `a..<b`), logical operators (`&&` `||`, `!foo`)
 */


/*:
 * callout(comments):
 single line, multi line
