//: ### Enumerations, Classes and Structures
/*:
 * callout(enumerations):
 declaration (single line, multi-line), raw values, associated values (`case(SomeType)`), computed instance properties, stored and computed type properties, instance and type methods, initalizers and subscripts
 */
// decalre an enum


// enum with instance methods


// enum with raw value


// enum with associated values

/*:
 * callout(structures):
 structures (and enumerations) are _value types_ - a type whose value is copied when it is assigned to a variable or constant, or when it is passed to a function
 */
// declare a structure


// value types are copied on assignment


/*:
 * callout(classes):
 classes are _reference types_ - are not copied when they are assigned to a variable or constant, or when they are passed to a function. Unlike structs, a class can inherit methods and properties (`override`, `final` and `super`)
 */
// decalre a class


// reference types are not copied on assignment


// inheritance


/*:
 * callout(type casting):
 checking with `is` downcast with `as?` and `as!`, `Any` and `AnyObject`
 */
// check which type (is)


// downcast (as?, as!)


/*:
 * callout(nested types):
  swift enables you to define nested types, whereby you nest supporting enumerations, classes, and structures within the definition of the type they support
