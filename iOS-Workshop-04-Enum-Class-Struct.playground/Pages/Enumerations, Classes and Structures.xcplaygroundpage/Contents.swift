//: ### Enumerations, Classes and Structures
/*:
 * callout(enumerations):
 declaration (single line, multi-line), raw values, associated values (`case(SomeType)`), computed instance properties, stored and computed type properties, instance and type methods, initalizers and subscripts
 */


/*:
 * callout(structures):
 structures (and enumerations) are _value types_ - a type whose value is copied when it is assigned to a variable or constant, or when it is passed to a function
 */


/*:
 * callout(classes):
 classes are _reference types_ - are not copied when they are assigned to a variable or constant, or when they are passed to a function. Unlike structs, a class can inherit methods and properties (`override`, `final` and `super`)
 */


/*:
 * callout(type casting):
 checking with `is` downcast with `as?` and `as!`, `Any` and `AnyObject`
 */


/*:
 * callout(nested types):
  swift enables you to define nested types, whereby you nest supporting enumerations, classes, and structures within the definition of the type they support
