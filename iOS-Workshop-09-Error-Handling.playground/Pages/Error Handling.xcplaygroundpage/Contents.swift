//: ### Error Handling
//: * Swift provides support for throwing, catching, propagating, and manipulating recoverable errors at runtime
//: * Errors are represented by values of types that conform to the Error protocol
//: * This empty protocol indicates that a type can be used for error handling

/*:
 * callout(error types and throwing errors):
 using `throw` and the `Error` protocol, error handling by propagation (using `throws`), error handling with do-catch, error handling by converting to optionals (`try?`), disable error propagation (`try!`)
 */
// define custom error type


// throwing errors (throws)


// handling errors (do ... catch)


// convert errors to optionals (try?)


// opting out of error propagation (try!)


/*:
 * callout(cleanup actions):
 using `defer`
 */
// defer statement defers execution until the current scope is exited
